# Microservices API Project

##**Objective**

###The goal of this exercise is to gain hands-on experience with microservice API design by implementing a simple system of intercommunicating services. The system will manage Products, Customers, and Orders, each through independent microservices.

##**System Overview**

###The project consists of three independent microservices
  * **Product Service:** Handles product-related data.
  * **Customer Service:** Handles customer-related data.
  * **Order Service:** Handles order-related data and communicates with the Product and Customer Services to validate data before creating an order.
